<system:String x:Key="HintSEN"   xml:space="preserve">[SEN] defines the maximum steering angle you can turn the wheel.Default is "Auto",
then the game takes care of a realistic steering angle for each car.
This can be adjusted for personal preference or some games that don't support "Auto"
A lower value makes the steering more direct.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintFF" xml:space="preserve">[FF] adjusts the overall force feedback strength of all effects coming from a game equally.
100% will use the full torque the Wheel Base can produce, 50% will only result in half of the torque the Base could output.
Different kind of effects like Force, Spring or Damper can be adjusted separately below.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintSHO"   xml:space="preserve">[SHO] adjusts the vibration strength of the rumble motors placed inside of ClubSport steering wheels.
Vibration effects can be output from the game or the FanaLab Software.
This setting will not influence force feedback effects.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintABS"   xml:space="preserve">[ABS] adjusts the brake pedal threshold to trigger vibration,
default is OFF which only allows games to control the vibration..
If you set it to 100% the vibration will start when you press the pedal 100%.
If you set it to 95% it will vibrate at 95% pressure and higher.
This only works with ClubSport Pedals V3 and V3i that are connected to the Wheel Base.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintDRI"   xml:space="preserve">[DRI] adjusts the resistance of the wheel, default is the lowest value to prevent oscillations in less optimized games.
For personal preference and a faster response the value can be raised to get less resistance.
Try to find a good balance between low resistance for fast reaction time and enough resistance to keep the behavior stable.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintFOR"   xml:space="preserve">[FOR] adjusts the strength of Force Effects coming from a game, default is 100%. 
Games use this effect to control most of the FFB. Some games only use Force Effects.
100% will use the maximum torque selected by the overall strength [FF].
50% will only use half of the torque selected by the overall strength [FF].</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintSPR"   xml:space="preserve">[SPR] adjusts the strength of the Spring Effects coming from a game, default is 100%. 
Sometimes used as a menu center spring or re-alignment force while driving.
This is not a constant spring, it's only controlled by the game and will not result in any effect other than what the game outputs.
100% will use the maximum torque selected by the overall strength [FF].
50% will only use half of the torque selected by the overall strength [FF].</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintDPR"   xml:space="preserve">[DPR] adjusts the strength of the Damper Effects coming from a game, default is 100%. 
Sometimes used to dampen oscillations or simulating the tyre resistance when standing still and turning the wheel.
This is not a constant damper, it's only controlled by the game and will not result in any effect other than what the game outputs.
100% will use the maximum torque selected by the overall strength [FF].
50% will only use half of the torque selected by the overall strength [FF].</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintNDP"   xml:space="preserve">[NDP] adjusts a constant damper which is not influenced by the game, default is 50% to prevent oscillations.
In comparison to Natural Friction the resistance of the damper increases with the steerings turning speed.
At 100% the steering will have the most resistance and is very hard to turn.
At 0% the steering wheel will have the least resistance, this can lead to oscillations and bad behaviour depending on the game
and how strong the FFB is set to, use lower values with caution!
Try to find a good balance between low resistance for fast reaction time and enough resistance to keep the behavior stable.
Suggested values are between 10-50% depending on the FFB strength and behaviour.</system:String>

<system:String x:Key="HintNFR"   xml:space="preserve">[NFR] adjusts a constant friction effect which is not influenced by a game, default is off.
The setting can be used to prevent oscillations or simulate the steering rack of a car without power steering.
In comparison to the Natural Damper, resistance of Friction acts more linear with different rotation speeds of the wheel.
At 100% the steering will have the most resistance and is very hard to turn. 
At 0% the steering wheel will have the least resistance.
Try to find a good balance between low resistance for the most feel and enough resistance to keep the behavior stable.
A good window is between 0-15% for this setting depending on the FFB strength and behaviour.</system:String>

<system:String x:Key="HintFEI"   xml:space="preserve">[FEI] adjusts how intense or smooth the effects from a game will be.
100% is the most sharp and direct setting but can be very harsh and result in rattling depending on the game.
0% is very smooth with less rattle but subtle effects and feeling can get lost.
Try to find a good balance between enough detailed FFB effects without resulting in noisy rattle.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintBRF"   xml:space="preserve">[BRF] adjusts the sensitivity of the brake pedal if supported pedals are connected to the Wheel Base.
Default value is 50%, you can raise or lower the value for personal preference.
100% means you have to press the brake pedal harder to get full brake input, more difficult to lock up the wheels while braking.
0% means you have to press the brake pedal less hard to get full brake input, easier to lock up the wheels while braking.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintMPS"   xml:space="preserve">Select the mode of the Multi-Position-Switch of your steering wheel.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintMPSModeAuto"   xml:space="preserve">The MPS works by default in Encoder mode.
Games which support the MPS natively can automatically switch the mode for full functionality.
With this setting you have the best working mode automatically selected.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintMPSModeEncoder"   xml:space="preserve">The MPS works as a classic encoder with two inputs, one for turning left and one for turning right.
This setting is for games that don't support the MPS natively and works with most of the games out of the box.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintMPSModeConstant"   xml:space="preserve">The MPS has 12 positions with unique inputs for each position, the input of the currently selected position is constantly send. 
This needs to be supported by the game and can cause problems with games that don't feature the MPS this.
Only use it for games you know that are supported.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintMPSModePulse"   xml:space="preserve">The MPS has 12 positions with unique inputs for each position, the input is only send as a pulse when changing the position. 
This needs to be supported by the game to take full advantage. This setting can be used when CONST causes problems.
Only select this when you want to use 12 different positions but CONST causes problems in the game.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintAPM"   xml:space="preserve">Select the mode of Advanced Paddle Module of your steering wheel.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintApCbp" xml:space="preserve">Left and right paddle work in parallel. The paddle that is pressed further is valid.
Adjusting: Pull one paddle compeltely, then press D-Pad down until the car is rolling.
Using: Pull both paddles, release one instantly at start, then let the second one go in a controlled way.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintApCh" xml:space="preserve">The left paddle will controll the clutch and the right paddle the handbrake.</system:String>
<system:String x:Key="HintApBt" xml:space="preserve">The left paddle will controll the brake and the right paddle the throttle.</system:String>
